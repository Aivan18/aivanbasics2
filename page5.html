	<fieldset>Unrequited love: A Gay Man's Secret Crush
	<p>By Aivan </p>
	
	<p>In secret, my heart beats fast,
	For a love that cannot last.
	A straight man, my crush, so true.
	But to him, my love, I cannot pursue. 
	<p></p>
	I watch him from afar,
	And wonder what might be. 
	If only he could see
	The love that burns within my heart. 
	<p></p>
	But fear holds me back
	From confessing my love
	For fear of losing him
	And the friendship we have built. 
	<p></p>
	So I keep my feelings locked away
	And hope that someday, He'll see me in a different light
	And my love for him will take flight. 
	<p></p>
	But until that day arrives
	I'll keep my love locked deep inside
	And hope that one day he'll see
	The love that burns so bright.</fieldset>
